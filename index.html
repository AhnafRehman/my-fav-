            I like drawing since I was 6 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. I have decorated my house with lot of my drawings.The strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by random youtubers drawing amazing stuff by doing simple things. I hope you learned loads about my hobby.
